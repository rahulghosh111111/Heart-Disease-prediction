# Heart Disease Prediction 🫀

A web-based application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on medical parameters. This project leverages machine learning for prediction and Flask for developing the interactive web interface.

## 🔍 Overview

This application allows users to input health-related data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The backend uses a trained machine learning model to analyze the data and predict the risk of heart disease. It's designed to serve as an awareness and early assessment tool—not a substitute for professional medical advice.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts heart disease risk using input parameters
- User-friendly web interface built with Flask
- Real-time predictions
- Trained machine learning model for backend logic

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Flask** – Web application framework
- **Scikit-learn** – Model training and prediction
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data preprocessing
- **HTML/CSS** – Frontend styling

## 📦 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulghosh111111/heart-disease-prediction.git
